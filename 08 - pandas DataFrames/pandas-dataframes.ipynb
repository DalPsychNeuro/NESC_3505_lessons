        "## What is pandas?\n",
        "\n",
        "Bad news first: there are no cute, black-and-white bears here. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) (whose official name starts with a lower-case \"p\") is a Python *library* for working with data in a tabular format, such as is found in file formats like CSV, Microsoft Excel, and Google Sheets. Unlike Excel or Sheets, pandas is not a point-and click graphical interface for working with these files — everything is done through Python code. But compared to other formats for working with data that we have seen in this workshop, such as lists and dictionaries, pandas may seem more familiar, and it definitely lends itself more naturally to large data sets. Indeed, pandas' mission statement is, \"...to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python\". \n",
        "\n",
        "The primary units of pandas data storage you will work with are [DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html#min-tut-01-tableoriented) (essentially, tables of data organized as rows and columns). DataFrames are actually collections of pandas [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html) objects, which can be thought of as individual rows or columns (or vectors, or 1D arrays). \n",
        "\n",
        "Among the things that make pandas so attractive are the powerful interface to access individual records of the table, proper handling of missing values, and relational-databases operations between DataFrames. As well, pandas functions and methods are written to work intuitively and efficiently with data organized in tables. Most operations are *vectorized*, which means that they will automatically apply to all values in a DataFrame or Series without the need to write `for` loops to execute the same operation on a set of cells.\n",
        "\n",
        "pandas is built on top of the [NumPy](https://numpy.org) library. Although we haven't discussed NumPy in this workshop, it is a powerful and widely used Python library for working with numerical data. However, it's worth noting for your future reference that most of the methods defined for NumPy Arrays also apply to Pandas Series/DataFrames."

        "## About Python Libraries\n",
        "\n",
        "pandas is an example of a Python library. A **library** is a collection of files (called *modules*) that contains functions for use by other programs. Libraries provide ways of extending Python's functionality in different ways. They may also contain data values (e.g., numerical constants), entire sample data sets, and other things. A library's contents are supposed to be related, although there's no actual way to enforce that.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Python [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) is an extensive suite of modules that comes with Python itself. Everything we've done so far in this workshop has been part of the standard library. Many additional libraries are available; CoCalc has a large number of extra libraries already installed.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use a library in a particular Jupyter notebook or other Python program, we must import it using the `import` statement, like this:\n",

        "import pandas\n",
        "~~~\n",
        "\n",
        "Once a library is imported, we can use functions and methods from it. But, for functions we have to tell Python that the function can be found in a particular library we imported. For example, pandas has a function to import data from CSV (comma-separated value) files, called `read_csv`. To run this command, we would need to type:\n",
